Post.create({title:"Get to Know Your Denim", image: "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/wl52ax9fphrva7pf7zix.jpg", content: "There's no shortage of places to buy a decent, stylish pair of jeans in New York City. But for those religious about their denim—or who are just looking for that elusive, perfect pair—there's only one place you really need to go: 3x1, the brainchild of former Evisu designer and Paper, Denim, Cloth founder Scott Morrison. And while 3x1's Mercer Street storefront might not look like the most important place to buy jeans in the universe, it won't take more than a few seconds inside for you to figure the whole thing out. On the right are different cuts of denim, hung in plexiglass boxes on the wall, the fine art treatment for a pair of pants. Towards the back you'll probably catch a seamstress or two in the workshop, which is right there, in-house, working on jeans you could soon walk out wearing. In the center of the room, you'll find denim customizations of every possible variant, waiting for you to pick from them: Rivets, buttons, pocket shapes, linings, pipings, selvedge strips, interior pocket patterns. If there's a way to customize a pair of jeans, they have it, and they will do it. But nothing will prepare you for what's on the left side of the room: The Denim Wall. No, really: It's a wall that feels like a mountain, stacked topped to bottom with various giant spools of denim, and denim that's been personally collected from all over the world and brought here, for you. Black denim, grey denim, blue denim that fades to purple, purple denim that fades blue, denim as heavy as shag carpet or as light as tracing paper, denim that tastes like schnozzberries, etc. And yeah, we might've made one of those up, but then again, having seen with our own eyes the variants of denim Morrison has collected, and what one can do with them: For the right price? We wouldn't put it past them, either. ", vote_up:0 , vote_down:0 , user_id:5 , location_id:67 , category_id:5})

The  thing that makes the Royal Palms stand out is the availability to make shuffleboard a drinking game. The place offers cocktail specials, delicious food trucks for some grub, and a massive space so that no one gets in your way.

Established in 1927 by Benjamin Bass on Fourth Avenue as part of “bookstore row,” it moved to its current location in the ‘50s as the sole survivor. With its three stories containing “18 miles” of books—possibly not including the dollar racks outside—The Strand is a very lively relic from the increasingly distant past, containing both claustrophobia-inducing racks reaching to the ceiling on the main floor and airy reading spaces in the art and photo sections on the second. The rare book room plays host to talks from prominent authors and artists, ranging from Raymond Pettibon to David Sedaris, as well as housing inscribed works as well as first editions. As book shopping becomes an evermore sterile experience, The Strand stands as a reminder that it doesn’t have to be that way.", vote_up:0 , vote_down:0 , user_id:4 , location_id:70 , category_id:5})

We did see the Planetarium Show, and while it was cool, I can see it being a little boring for some; I even found myself nodding off during the ~30 min. show, but that was probably related to the 4 days prior. While a nerd like me is mildly interested in dark matter and energy, I'm guessing normal people are less interested. The mineral/gem collection was really cool, but I didn't have the energy to spend as much time as I would have liked to really get the full experience. I also wished I had been able to spend more time in the earth/space part of the museum. I do wish that the pieces in the museum had more historical information. Most of the pieces lack dates and many are noted as reproductions, so it is often unclear if the piece is real or not, and how old it is.

Eleven Madison Park has been on my radar for years for various reasons. As a Seattleite I've been a fan of Jason Franey's for years. Any place he's worked is a place I want to eat. Another reason is that this restaurant has been voted amongst the top in the entire world years in a row. And finally, it's convenient because the NYC office of my company is located in the same building. So why not?! My fiancé and I took a weeklong trip to NYC to eat and drink our way through the city. The very highlight of our 6 day trip to over 20 bars/restaurants was eating here. Right upon entering you're warmly greeted by staff. They ask a few questions to learn about you and help customize the experience. We were then seated along the back wall in a position so that we could watch everything going on around us. For such a gorgeous and intimate feeling space, it's amazing how busy and loud it gets. Not loud in a way that affects your meal, but loud in a way that you're there and you're part of a communal experience with tons of other people eating the city's best dishes. Even with the buzzing of the staff and the commotion of other tables it wasn't necessary for me to shout or stretch to hear what my fiancé was saying as we talked through the nearly 4 hour, 15 course meal. Table service is exquisite. If you watch, you'll spot staff members whose job it is to just watch the floor and take action when needed. If an empty plate or glass of water has sat for 1 second too long, they jump in and come to the rescue. For many dishes the kitchen staff comes out and begins to prepare or explain the dish upon arrival.

They use square block cubes for their cocktails which is nice. The way my drink was made was perfect in terms of the amount of each ingredient. Jonathan, the head bartender, did an amazing job talking to my friend and I about NY and drinks. Even though they were slammed, him and his crew took the time to get intimate with their customers on the bar. They are quick and efficient here.

I went on a recent visit to check out the food there and overall was very satisfied with the classic food coming out from the kitchen. I would say the food at the restaurant is probably closer to traditional than modern, but that doesn't mean the food is boring or pedestrian. I enjoyed grilled baby octopus and cuttlefish so much on a bed of fava beans puree. The octopus and cuttlefish was cooked very nicely, and I loved the fact that they weren't over-seasoned but rather worked with the puree for a rustic yet satisfying flavor. The restaurant has a selection of pizzas, and the tartufo nero pie with mozzarella, fontina, parmigiano and black truffle was a winner, again with modest seasoning that helped enhance the flavor of black truffle. I found the squid ink spaghetti with baby clams, garlic and white wine sauce to be a little bit too oily even though the noodle was cooked with nice firmness. For the main dish, we went for the oven roasted whole branzino (the menu shows sea bream but the server offered branzino with the same style) served in a cherry tomato sauce with olives and capers, and I really liked the perfectly cooked fish that wasn't heavy to my liking.

I am disappointed in the process necessary to register for the walk up to the crown (almost six months in advance or more), but our Lady Liberty is aging and I understand the precautions and limitations necessary to preserve her. She's as grand as ever after her recent cleaning and restoration. I got to see her with a real flame when I was a kid, but now the torch is lit with a gold flame sculpture that reflects sunlight during the day and is lit artificially at night with lights.Some hints for families. If you're going to get inside Lady Liberty, and especially the crown, you need to reserve the tickets online well in advance. On your date of visit, arrive at Battery Park EARLY, like 8am. Ignore all the ticket hawkers and go directly to the round Castle Clinton to buy or pick up your tickets. If you arrive even as late as 10am, you will end up with a 3 hour wait time between the ticket lines and the security checkpoint lines.Food and water. Bring it with you in a backpack. Carry two waters for each person in your group, and pack food that does not require refrigeration and has protein to carry you through the day, like PBJ sandwiches. The only place to eat on Liberty Island is the Liberty Cafe, and it is an absolute tourist trap in every way (expensive, unorganized, and bad food). Trust me, if you eat at the Cafe, you'll wish you'd brought the sandwiches!Lastly, if you are a police officer in NY or NJ, bring your sidearm, just like you would if you were off duty in your own area. After you get your tickets, respectfully approach the first security person you see and identify yourself and let them know you are armed. They will whisk you and your family through the security line and save you the long wait. If you are going into the Statue of Liberty, you will have to lock up your sidearm along with your backpack on Liberty Island, but no big deal. Unfortunately, police officers from other outside states are not given this courtesy, so leave your sidearm at home, or locked in the hotel safe for this particular day; they will not even let you board the boat from Battery Park.Enjoy your day!", vote_up: 0, vote_down: 0, user_id: 1, location_id: 26, category_id: 2 })

Post.create({title:"Made My 3 Year Old SO Happy", image:"http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Intrepid-Museum-Vertical-Logo.jpg", content:" My son is going to turn 3 in a month. He loves planes, helicopters, boats and space ships so I thought that a father son day at the Intrepid would be a good idea. I was a little worried after reading some reviews that we would be stuck in long lines and he would get antsy and bored before we even got in so I researched the heck out of it. I opted to purchase tickets online Friday night and pick them up at will call the next day. It turns out, kids under 3 are free. I knew that I only had so much time with a kid his age, so I got a 'GA - General Admission including Space Shuttle Pavilion' ticket for myself, no ticket for him. So yesterday, a sunny somewhat warm spring Saturday, we made our way to the west side. The Hudson River can be cold and windy, so sunny and warm is important. We arrived at 9:45, the museum opens at 10:00 to the public. There was a line with about 40 people in it but they were all in the ticket line. The will call line was empty! At 10:00 on the dot, they let us in. Will call went without a hitch and by 10:05 we were the first people to walk in the gates. I wondered if I would need some proof of age for my son since he was free, but nobody asked. I just stated that he was under 3. I could not have been happier! My thoughts were, lets get up to the bridge (the tallest point on the ship) before the crowds get in there. It was a good plan. My son absolutely loved going in the ship. Lots of those oval ship doorways, hallways and stairs. Steep, narrow stairways. Very hazardous to children, elderly, overweight and out-of-shape people. I asked the first employee I saw how many people get tripped up in here and he chuckled and said 'too many to count'. I did question my decision to bring my under 3 year old up there but since there was absolutely nobody there other than us, we were able to take our time and not feel rushed or like we were in the way. We did well, but it was not without risk. Going down is even more perilous than going up. The stairs are almost ladders. We made it all the way to the bridge and back down without seeing another tourist. A nice older gentlemen named 'Buddy', who I suspect was a veteran, gave my son a collectible Intrepid card. Very nice. After exiting onto the deck I thought, lets go see the space shuttle before it gets crowded. So we made our way to the Shuttle pavilion. The door was closed and it looked dark but when we entered. Again, we were the first ones to enter! Success! You need to present your separate Shuttle ticket on entry. They then take your photo against a blue wall with the hopes of luring you into purchasing a photo package when you exit. For the record, the space shuttle Enterprise never actually flew into space. It was used for training. It was a nice experience and my sons eyes lit up when he saw the 'spaceship', or 'rocket ship' but if time or money is limited, not sure it is worth the extra money. You cannot enter the shuttle. There are stairs that go up and wrap around the front end of the shuttle and there are some exhibits, but I have been to Cape Canaveral in Florida and this was nothing compared to that. On exit, we were presented with the photo package. I actually bought just the large photo because it was a nice photo of my son and I and I thought it would be a nice keepsake for my sons wall, but it was a complete rip-off at $22.25. It is insulting how much they charge. We were getting hungry so we headed to the onboard Au Bon Pain chain. We had a nice mozzarella sandwich and of course, an ice cream! The ice cream is just a good humor fridge, no cones, but 3 year olds are not that discerning when it comes to ice cream, so Spiderman ice cream on a stick it was. I wanted to watch the good looking documentary with smoke machines but this was 'scary' to my son. We then saw some anti-aircraft guns and toured the deck full of planes and helicopters. We skipped the sub and Concord that required extra tickets. I HIGHLY recommend eating at the nearby Gotham Market afterwards, a wonderful food market. My son and I had a blast!

Police horses are there at times and you can usually go up and pat them (I'm an animal lover, so that's a favourite for me). Down on the street can be a real pain sometimes due to the crowds, with some really rude people just shoving and pushing their way through.

The vibe in the shop is very personal, yet hippie-esq, as guests are able to play an entire record if they choose while shopping through racks on racks of underground artists and experimental musicians. Hands down, the employees are very knowledgeable and are always willing to help customers dig into some great finds. There’s even a “cheapies” section that offers discs as low as a buck. This place is definitely a hidden treasure within the city.", vote_up:0 , vote_down:0 , user_id: 2, location_id:69 , category_id:5})
